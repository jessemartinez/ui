Files in the Snippets directory are the chunks of HTML needed display individual fields, groups or sections to a
procedure or authority form. You copy copy the snippets into an existing template to add that field, group or section.
This is particularly useful if you only want to use part of an extension.

Files in the Templates directory are copies of the default templates modified to include the snippets. You can drop the
template files into your tenant's "html/pages" directory to use them.
